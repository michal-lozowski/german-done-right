Can you (informal tone) please turn the light off?

The TV's broken... I'll put it away.

My bike isn't there! Oh no! Where's my bike? My bike's gone!

It's cold today. Peter puts a sweater and a jacket on.

Why don't you put your jacket on? It's really cold outside!

The bus drove off and I was just too far away. I had to wait for the next one.

Should I turn the light on?

Can you (informal tone) please close the door?

Can you (formal tone) please take your shoes off?
